# Installation
This project is part of the udacity term1 robotics nanodegree. 

Follow the directions in the following link for setup 
<https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Python-StarterKit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md> 

Once installed source the environment

```
source activate RoboND
```

To uninstall  
```
conda env remove -n RoboND
```  

# Required software
To run the project you need the rover simulator which is built on top of unity game engine. 

The binary install files are below

The original simulator source is [here](https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Rover-Unity-Simulator)

##Using the simulator
Launch the simulator and you can run in either manual or autonomous mode, the latter is the mode we need to launch it in order to use our driver code for autonomous navigation. 

Manual Controls  

Experiment in Training Mode with the various manual functions.

* Throttle, brake and steering: wsad letters or arrow keys (can also steer with mouse)
* Toggle mouse function between camera perspective and steering: esc key  
* Change the viewing perspective: Tab key or mouse
Change zoom on the viewing camera: mouse scroll
* Reset viewing camera zoom: middle mouse button (MMB)
* Activate the robot arm to pick up a sample: left mouse button (LMB) or enter key (only works when is near objective = yes)
* You can record the image stream coming from this camera by hitting the **r** key (you'll need to hit **r** a second time to stop recording and save the data). You'll see a dialog box that allows you to choose a folder for saving data. Navigate to a folder where you would like to save the data and click Select. The simulator will create a subfolder called IMG to store the image data and write a .csv file listing full image path names, and values for steering, throttle, brake, speed, position, pitch, yaw and roll.

# Autonomous Navigation
* Launch the rover simulator and start it in autonomous mode
* Then run driver_rover.py script at the terminal and this will start the autonomous navigation
